## üéØ Features

- Recursive website crawling with configurable depth
- Concurrent crawling using multithreading for blazing speed
- Detection of common admin and sensitive paths
- Terminal-style website structure display with intuitive file icons
- Responsive and accessible web UI with smooth terminal text animation
- Efficient handling of large websites with thread-safe data structures

---

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technical Details

- **Concurrency Model:** Uses Python's `threading` module with a thread pool to fetch multiple URLs in parallel.
- **Queue Management:** URLs to visit are managed in a thread-safe queue to avoid race conditions.
- **HTML Parsing:** Utilizes BeautifulSoup for robust HTML parsing and link extraction.
- **Admin Path Detection:** Checks URLs against a comprehensive list of common admin paths.
- **File Structure:** Builds a hierarchical tree structure representing the website's files and directories.
- **Frontend:** Flask serves a responsive UI with a terminal-style display and animated typing effect using JavaScript.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

| Parameter    | Description                                | Default |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------|---------|
| max_threads  | Number of concurrent threads for crawling | 10      |
| max_depth    | Maximum crawl depth                        | 7       |

---

## üìö How It Works

1. The crawler starts from the given URL.
2. It fetches pages concurrently using multiple threads.
3. Parses HTML to find links and resources.
4. Detects common admin paths and flags them.
5. Builds a hierarchical tree of the website structure.
6. Displays the results in a terminal-style UI with animated typing effect.
